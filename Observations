Observations:
    Lower latitudes results in higher temperatures
    Latitude appears to have little impact on humidity, slight impact as the latitude gets higher
    Cloudiness is evenly distributed based on latitude, slight impact as latitude gets higher
    Wind speed is pretty much consistent across latitude, with spikes on the low and high ends of the spectrum
